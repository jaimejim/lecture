# Lecture Notes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaimejim/lecture.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaimejim/lecture)

Here is a compilation of notes and potential lecture materials around various topics I have condensed in the past few months.

The notes are written in markdown and generated using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook). The contents are [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/jaimejim/lecture/blob/master/LICENSE) and so is any code they might contain. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaimejim/lecture).

Please report issues and feature requests on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jaimejim/lecture/issues).
