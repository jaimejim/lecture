# Jaime's Notes

Here is a compilation of notes and potential lecture materials around various topics I have condensed over the course of `1 month`.

The notes are written in markdown and generated using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook).

The contents are [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/jaimejim/lecture/blob/master/LICENSE) and so is any code they might contain. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaimejim/lecture). Issues and feature requests can be posted on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jaimejim/lecture/issues).
